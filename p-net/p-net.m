% project probabilistic network p-net
% 1. set up the signals. try to get the values for every signal.
% 2. check every closing price for potential: the results of that signal
% did it win? lose? win high? lose high? whats the criteria?
% we have TP1, TP2, SL1, SL2
% case 1: if TP1 is reached before SL1 (weak buy)
% case 2: if TP2 is reached before SL1 (strong buy)
% case 3: if SL1 is reached before TP1 (weak sell)
% case 4: if SL2 is reached before TP1 (strong sell)
% time requirements: depending on the time the target was reached.
% classify levels from 0 to 10 depending on who was reached first + time it
% took to reach it.
% try to combine indicators in 2 categories, trend strength and expected
% reverse.
